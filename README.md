## Integration Process Overview
The process of integrating BRIA's iFrame into your web application consists of three main steps:

### Step 1: Create Your iFrame on BRIA's Platform
Begin by creating your iFrame on BRIA's platform. Here, you have the flexibility to customize the iFrame's features and user experience to align with the needs of your product's users. You can also tailor the iFrame's appearance to match your brand's style. Once you have configured the iFrame to your satisfaction, BRIA's platform will provide you with a unique URL. This URL is specifically generated for your iFrame to be embedded into your website. Use this URL in the `<iframe>` tag src attribute, check `index.html` file as an example.

### Step 2: Embed Your Unique BRIA's URL on Your Site
The next step involves embedding the unique URL provided by BRIA into your web application. This integration allows the iFrame to become a part of your site, offering a cohesive and integrated user experience.

### Step 3: Listen to Post Messages from the iFrame
Finally, it's essential to set up a mechanism to listen to post messages generated by the iFrame. This step is crucial for streamlining user actions into your own system. For example, you can capture and save customized images created by users in your own image repository. This integration ensures that user interactions with the iFrame are seamlessly incorporated into your web application's workflow.

By following these steps, you can successfully integrate BRIA's iFrame into your web application, enhancing its capabilities and offering a unique experience to your users.
